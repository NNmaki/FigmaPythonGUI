# Figma GUI to Python code (with Tkinter Designer -tool)

## 📌 Description 

This is an exercise converting a UI framework created in Figma into Python code, with an added feature for saving entered data directly to an Excel-sheet.

This is made possible by the Tkinter Designer tool (Copyright (c) 2021, Parth Jadhav), which as the name suggests, uses Python’s Tkinter library -the most commonly used library for creating UI-applications in Python.

As an experiment, I created a small form-like UI in Figma, which I then converted to Python code. I also added the Openpyxl library into the converted code, allowing the user’s form entries to be saved directly to an Excel sheet. Or creating it if it doesn't excist.

Although similar results can certainly be achieved more easily with ready-made tools, this exercise demonstrates that comparable functionality can be accomplished locally without additional cloud services or coding the entire application from scratch. However, enabling Excel-saving required quite a bit of code modification.

## 👨‍🏫 Steps I followed for creating Python-code:

1. Create form or UI of your choice using Figma
2. Remember to name Elements in Figma correctly
3. Install needed libraries and depencies
4. In figma, create token and copy it together with file url adress.
5. Execute Tkinter Designer-script, and insert generated tokens
6. Click translate, and tool should do the conversion
7. Check the generated code, import OpenPyxl library and modify code referring OpenPyxl -documentation.
8. Run modified gui.py -script, fill form and check if the excel file appears.
9. Enjoy the result. 🙂
